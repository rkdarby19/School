Knapsack and FractionalKnapsack

Mid-square hash functions, 
	A mid-square hash squares the key, extracts R digits from the result's middle, and returns the remainder of 
	the middle digits divided by hash table size N. Ex: For a hash table with 100 entries and a key of 453, the 
	decimal (base 10) mid-square hash function computes 453 * 453 = 205209, and returns the middle two digits 52. 
	For N buckets, R must be greater than or equal to log10N
 	to index all buckets. The process of squaring and extracting middle digits reduces the likelihood of keys mapping to just a few 	buckets.

	A binary mid-square hash function extracts the middle R bits, and returns the remainder of the middle bits 
	divided by hash table size N, where R is greater than or equal to Log2N
	. Ex: For a hash table size of 200, R = 8, then 8 bits are needed for indices 0 to 199.
